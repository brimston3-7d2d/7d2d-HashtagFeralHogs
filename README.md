# #FeralHogs, a 7 days to die mod

Inspired by texas ag and twitter.

This modlet changes the horde and screamer spawners to summon aggressive feral hogs. No attempt at gameplay balance or scaling was attempted, so use at your own risk. The developer cannot be held responsible for friendly fire encountered while using this modlet.
